# [ProjectName] Design Brief

## A brief summary of the business / site goals.
An aggregate schedule of yoga classes, curated by a yoga snob.  The app solves the problem of finding fantastic teachers at different studios.  It should also encourage me to discover more yoga teachers to add to the list.

## The key users.
Yogis that are trying to fit their 1.5 hours of refuge into their busy schedules.  They are generally young professionals, both male and female, but predominantly female and peeople that are health conscious.

## Scenarios in which your app or site will be used.
They should be able to get to the site quickly, process the class information easily and add class details to their calendars.

## Design style guidelines to follow.
- Calming
- Connected to the world (more analog feel)
